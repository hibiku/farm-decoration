(This chance is believed to affect both you and others, but there is no confirmation.)</dd><dt><dfn id="bonus-banked">Building Max Waru Capacity</dfn></dt><dd>Increase to the maximum amount of Waru that your buildings can store.</dd><dt><dfn>Monster Life Shop Discount</dfn></dt><dd>Waru discount applied to your purchases in the Monster Life Shop.</dd><dt><dfn id="bonus-visit">Special Merchant Visit Chance</dfn></dt><dd>Increase to the odds of special items appearing for sale in the Monster Life Shop. (Items that are normally unavailable or can only be purchased with Gems may sometimes become available for purchase with Waru, but at a quantity of one per item per visit.)</dd></dl><p>If any of these perks are important to you, and/or you are accumulating Waru at a rate faster than you are exhausting them, you can benefit from replacing some buildings/roads for decors.</p><p>Although farms are capped at a total of <b>999999</b> aesthetic points, only a total of <b>959700</b> aesthetic points are required to achieve the maximum effects of the perks.</p><p>Note, however, that at its maximum effect, the <b>Building Max Waru Capacity</b> perk will increase the storage capacities of buildings by only <b>128</b>, a small fraction of the base storage capacities of most buildings. As these gains will typically be offset by those from simply using additional buildings, <strong>this perk should be seen as a byproduct of improving your farm's beauty</strong>, rather than as a goal in itself.</p><p>Keep in mind that as you use more decors on your farm, the number of <em>additional</em> aesthetic points required to reach the next tier for perks <a href="#beauty-chart">will undergo a gradual net increase</a>. For this reason, it is common practice to stop improving the beauty of one's farm after a certain point. Notable breakpoints include <b>274700</b> and <b>653600</b> aesthetic points, at which the mentioned increased number of required <em>additional</em> aesthetic points becomes sustained.</p></section><section id="building-decor-choice"><h3>Which buildings/decors should I be using?</h3><p>As buildings/decors come in different sizes, their individual effects can only be meaningfully compared on a <em>per tile</em> basis.</p><p>It is recommended to use buildings with one or more of the following properties:</p><ul><li><a href="#top-waru">High production rate <em>per tile</em></a></li><li><a href="#top-banked">High storage capacity <em>per tile</em></a></li></ul><p>It is recommended to use decors with the following property:</p><ul><li><a href="#top-decor">High aesthetic points <em>per tile</em></a></li></ul><p>While buildings are also a source of aesthetic points, they do not provide nearly the amount that decors do, nor do they receive bonuses from road network effects in the form of increased aesthetic points.</p><hr><p id="top-waru">The three buildings with the highest production rate <em>per tile</em> are as follows:</p><ol><li><dl><dt>Ludibrium Toy House</dt><dd>A <b>4×4</b> tile building with a base production rate of <b>11.438</b> Waru per 10 mins <em>per tile</em>, a base storage capacity of <b>125</b> Waru <em>per tile</em>, and a base production time of <b>110</b> mins.</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Wholesome Milk Farm</dt><dd>A <b>2×2</b> tile building with a base production rate of <b>10</b> Waru per 10 mins <em>per tile</em>, a base storage capacity of <b>175</b> Waru <em>per tile</em>, and a base production time of <b>180</b> mins.</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Tip-Top Balloon Shop</dt><dd>A <b>2×2</b> tile building with a base production rate of <b>8.75</b> Waru per 10 mins <em>per tile</em>, a base storage capacity of <b>750</b> Waru <em>per tile</em>, and a base production time of <b>860</b> mins.</dd></dl></li></ol><p>In the case of the above buildings, there is a trade-off between production rates and storage capacities. Although the <b>Ludibrium Toy House</b> and <b>Wholesome Milk Farm</b> buildings have the highest production rates, they will reach maximum storage capacity much more quickly than the <b>Tip-Top Balloon Shop</b> building.</p><p>If you find yourself harvesting Waru from your buildings only at longer intervals, you may benefit from using buildings with larger storage capacities and/or foregoing roads for their <a href="#road-network-effects">network effects</a> in favor of additional buildings.</p><hr><p id="top-banked">The two buildings with the highest storage capacity <em>per tile</em> are as follows:</p><ol><li><dl><dt>Tip-Top Balloon Shop</dt><dd>A <b>2×2</b> tile building with a base production rate of <b>8.75</b> Waru per 10 mins <em>per tile</em>, a base storage capacity of <b>750</b> Waru <em>per tile</em>, and a base production time of <b>860</b> mins.</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Zakum's Cave</dt><dd>A <b>4×4</b> tile building with a base production rate of <b>3.75</b> Waru per 10 mins <em>per tile</em>, a base storage capacity of <b>750</b> Waru <em>per tile</em>, and a base production time of <b>2000</b> mins.</dd></dl></li></ol><p>The <b>Tip-Top Balloon Shop</b> building is exceptional because it has one of the highest storage capacities <em>per tile</em>, in addition to having one of the highest production rates <em>per tile</em>.</p><p>While the <b>Zakum's Cave</b> building has an equivalent storage capacity <em>per tile</em>, its production rate <em>per tile</em> and aesthetic points <em>per tile</em> are mediocre in comparison. Moreover, as it consumes more space, it cannot be used in the same quantity, and there will be fewer buildings to receive the effects of the <b><a href="#bonus-banked">Building Max Waru Capacity</a></b> perk. There should be no reason to choose it over the <b>Tip-Top Balloon Shop</b> building for long-term storage if you are able to obtain your desired quantity of the latter.</p><hr><p id="top-decor">The three decors with the highest aesthetic points <em>per tile</em> are:</p><ol><li><dl><dt>Cannon</dt><dd>A <b>1×1</b> tile decor that provides <b>3200</b> aesthetic points <em>per tile</em>.</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Rice Candy Set</dt><dd>A <b>1×1</b> tile decor that provides <b>2700</b> aesthetic points <em>per tile</em>.</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Big Bass</dt><dd>A <b>1×1</b> tile decor that provides <b>2700</b> aesthetic points <em>per tile</em>.</dd></dl></li></ol><p>While the above decors are always available in the Monster Life Shop, they are sometimes sold by the Special Merchant. It is worth noting that items purchased from the Special Merchant are considered distinct from their regular counterparts, and do not share limits in quantity (a maximum of <b>99</b> units) with their regular counterparts. It is therefore possible to make use of up to <b>198</b> units of each of the <b>Cannon</b>, <b>Rice Candy Set</b> and <b>Big Bass</b> decors, which are more than sufficient for any <a href="#decor-use">beauty needs</a>.</p><hr><p id="building-decor-context">Note that the above rankings of buildings/decors were in the context of their <em>base</em> effects. <strong>These rankings may change in different contexts</strong>, based on the following factors:</p><ul><li>The farm's use of the Aufheben monster's effect</li><li>The farm's total aesthetic points</li><li>The total number of roads neighboring the building</li></ul><p class="example"><b>Example:</b> A <b>Wholesome Milk Farm</b> building neighbored by <b>2</b> roads will have a total production rate of <b>12.75</b> Waru per 10 mins <em>per tile</em>, superseding the <b>Ludibrium Toy House</b> building, which will have a total production rate of <b>12.5</b> Waru per 10 mins <em>per tile</em>.</p><p>For a complete list of buildings/decors and their properties, and to see how buildings/decors rank under different conditions, check out the <a href="#building-data">Building data</a> and <a href="#decor-data">Decor data</a> sections below.</p></section><section id="road-use"><h3>Should I consider using roads?</h3><p>Roads are used primarily for their <dfn id="road-network-effects">network effects</dfn>, which are bonuses to any neighboring buildings/decors provided by roads that are connected to <b><a href="#my-house">My House</a></b>.
